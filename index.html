          <h2>The Question</h2>
          <p class="lead">TELL AND SHOW your data story and visualizations. Notice how this paragraph appears in a larger font than others, because the HTML code begins with a "lead" class.</p>

          <p>In the state of Connecticut’s primary education system, there are many inconsistencies with the distribution of funding to different districts. The financial health of a district is measured by the state through a metric known as “per pupil expenditures”, this metric clumps together the entirety of funding a district receives and divides it by the number of students enrolled in that district. This gauge measures how much funding can theoretically be allocated to each student. Schools that have the ability to spend more on their students fare much better than those who cannot. Our community partners have tasked us with finding out how the per-pupil expenditures vary by school district in the greater Hartford region, and how it has changed over time. These are vital questions to understanding the deeply seeded disparities in equality in educational access in the Hartford region as they inform viewers of the truth that certain districts are underfunded and have been historically underfunded while others continue to thrive.</p>


          <p>To assess this question, I turned to EdSight from the Connecticut department of education to find school funding data. I found “per-pupil-expenditures” data for the years 2017, 2019, and 2021 which I then combined in a sheets document. With these data points on hand I created a column to display the mean PPE data to get a better gauge at how much each district was spending on their students on average. I then made a percentage change formula column where I found the percentage growth / decline of funding in each district from 2017 to 2021. With all the data I needed on hand, I utilized the VLOOKUP function to find the data points for the select school districts in the greater Hartford region and I began thinking about visualizing the data. My first visualization was a choropleth map that I created in hopes of detailing the funding disparities (PPE differences) from school district to school district. As seen in <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/01bFy/1/">Figure 1</a>, having the range of colors on the map represent different levels of PPE, viewers are able to easily gauge what districts / regions are underfunded and which are not. By visualizing differences in PPE spending on a district wide basis, I feel as though the question of how student-spending varies by district was accurately answered.</p>

Areas that are shaded darker recieve more per pupil funding on average and lighter districts recieve less on average. This map serves to display disparities between district level funding.</p>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Relationship Between % Change in PPE and Mean PPE for Districts in the Greater Hartford Region" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-AD5XL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AD5XL/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="1378" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
          .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
          .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

          .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

          </style>
          <table class="tg">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header A</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header B</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header C</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">123</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">456</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">789</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">987</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">654</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">321</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
